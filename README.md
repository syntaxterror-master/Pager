# Pager

This is my second project and an early step in my journey into front-end development.
It's a simple pager interface created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The pager allows users to interact with a keypad to enter numbers or symbols, which 
are displayed dynamically on the screen. It also includes options to send or reset 
the input, making it an engaging and practical small-scale application.
